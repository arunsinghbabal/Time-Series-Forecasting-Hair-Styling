# Time-Series-Forecasting-Hair-Styling
#• Aim of the project:
Stabilise the device temperature over a period of time based on the historical data to provide a ideal styling conditions to
the user.
#• Accomplishments:
– Carried out the data extraction from the device and performed data analysis on it.
– Optimized the parameter values for the ARIMA (non-seasonal), SARIMAX (seasonal) and LSTM model for better
accuracy.
– Able to forecast for a very high frequency data (millisecond’s), which is impressive.
#• Deliverable:
Stable temperature is ideal for hair styling, this framework successfully predicts the future power output (correlated with
the temperature) to reduce the time lag.
